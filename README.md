# Pokedex

# Project description

Objective:  
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that  loads data from an external API  (Application Programming Interface) and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
Users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand. 

# Directions
Using the page either scroll through the names provided or use the navigation Finder item search bar to type in a specific name of a character filtering out all others. Then click on the name to have a modal appear with information and image of your character. To reset, close the modal or press the x in the search bar to start a new search.
